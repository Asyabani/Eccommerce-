     - Transaction amount
     - Payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal)
     - Transaction status (e.g., successful, pending, failed)
     - Transaction ID
   - Each transaction entry is clickable to view more detailed information.

2. **Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Users can filter transactions by:
     - Date range
     - Transaction status (e.g., successful, failed)
     - Payment method
   - Users can sort transactions by:
     - Date (newest to oldest, oldest to newest)
     - Amount (highest to lowest, lowest to highest)

3. **Detailed View:**

     - Transaction ID
     - Date and time of transaction
     - Item(s) purchased
     - Amount paid
     - Payment method used
     - Transaction status
     - Any relevant notes (e.g., reason for failure if applicable)
   - The detailed view includes options to download or print a receipt.

4. **Responsiveness:**

   - The user experience remains smooth and intuitive on both desktop and mobile.

5. **Performance:**
