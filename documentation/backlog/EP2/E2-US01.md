## User Story

**As a User**, I want to filter game vouchers by platform (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, PC) so that I can find products that are compatible with my gaming setup.

## Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (DoD)

1. **Filter Functionality:**
   - Users should be able to select one or multiple platforms (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, PC) from a list to filter game vouchers.
   - The filtering should be applied dynamically, showing only game vouchers that match the selected platforms.

2. **Form Validation:**
   - The filter form must validate user selections to ensure that at least one platform is chosen before applying the filter.
   - Validation should handle cases where invalid or unsupported platforms are selected.

3. **UI/UX:**
   - The filter options for platforms should be clearly visible and easily accessible in the user interface.
   - Users should see immediate feedback as they apply filters, with the filtered results updating without requiring a page reload.

4. **Filter Results:**
   - The filtered results must accurately reflect the selected platforms, showing only relevant game vouchers.
   - The results should include all relevant details (e.g., name, price, description) for each voucher.

5. **Performance:**
   - The filtering process should be optimized to ensure quick response times, even with a large number of game vouchers.
   - The system should handle multiple filter criteria efficiently.

6. **Database Integration:**
   - The filtering logic must be integrated with the database query to retrieve and display appropriate game vouchers based on the selected platforms.
   - The database schema should support efficient querying based on platform filters.

7. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests must be created and passed for the filter functionality to ensure it works as intended.
   - Integration tests should verify that the filter interacts correctly with the database and returns accurate results.
   - User acceptance tests must confirm that the filtering meets user needs and expectations.

8. **Accessibility:**
   - The filtering feature should be accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
   - The UI should adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring that all interactive elements related to filtering are usable.

9. **Security:**
   - Ensure that the filtering process does not expose any sensitive data or introduce vulnerabilities.
   - Implement security measures to protect against unauthorized access or manipulation of filter criteria.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Document the filter functionality, including how to use the filter options, the available platform options, and any relevant API endpoints.
    - Include details on the data model and how filtering is applied to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance.
