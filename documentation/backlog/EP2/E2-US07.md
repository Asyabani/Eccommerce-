## User Story

**As a user**, I want to view only available products to avoid trying to purchase something that is out of stock.

## Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (DoD)

1. **Availability Filter:**
   - Users should have the option to filter products by availability status (e.g., "Available," "In Stock").
   - The filter should be easily accessible and clearly labeled.

2. **Dynamic Filtering:**
   - When the availability filter is applied, the product listings should update dynamically to show only products that are in stock.
   - The filtering should be applied immediately, updating the results without requiring a page reload.

3. **UI/UX:**
   - The availability filter should be prominently displayed and intuitive to use.
   - The product listings should clearly indicate whether items are available or out of stock, with appropriate labels or icons.

4. **Filter Results:**
   - The filtered results should accurately reflect the selected availability status, showing only products that are in stock.
   - Each result should include relevant details such as name, price, description, and availability status.

5. **Performance:**
   - The filtering process should be optimized for fast response times, even with a large number of products.
   - The system should handle changes in availability filters efficiently.

6. **Database Integration:**
   - The availability filter must be integrated with the database to retrieve and display products based on their stock status.
   - The database schema must support efficient querying by availability.

7. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests must be created and passed for the availability filtering functionality.
   - Integration tests should ensure that the availability filter interacts correctly with the database and returns accurate results.
   - User acceptance tests must confirm that the availability filter meets user needs and expectations.

8. **Accessibility:**
   - The availability filter should be accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
   - The UI should adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring that all interactive elements related to availability filtering are usable.

9. **Security:**
