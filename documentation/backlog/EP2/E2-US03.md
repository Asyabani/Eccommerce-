## User Story

**As an Admin**, I want to delete products that are no longer available or relevant so that the store's inventory remains clean and up-to-date.

## Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (DoD)

1. **Delete Product:**
   - Admins should be able to access an option to delete a product from the product management interface.
   - The delete option should be available for each product listed in the inventory.
   - A confirmation prompt should appear to confirm the deletion action before proceeding.

2. **Confirmation and Error Handling:**
   - Admins should be required to confirm the deletion to prevent accidental removal of products.
   - If the deletion is successful, the product should be removed from the inventory and the user interface should be updated accordingly.
   - If the deletion fails, an appropriate error message should be displayed to the admin.

3. **UI/UX:**
   - The delete option should be clearly labeled and accessible in the product management interface.
   - The confirmation prompt should be user-friendly and clearly communicate the consequences of deleting the product.
   - After successful deletion, the product list should be updated in real-time without requiring a page reload.

4. **Data Persistence:**
   - The deleted product should be removed from the database and should no longer appear in the product listing.
   - Ensure that the system properly handles any related data, such as removing any references to the deleted product from other parts of the system (e.g., user wishlists, orders).

5. **Database Integration:**
   - The deletion logic must be correctly integrated with the database to remove the product entry.
   - The database schema should support efficient removal of product records.

6. **Performance:**
   - The deletion process should be optimized to ensure quick response times.
   - The system should handle multiple deletion requests efficiently.

7. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests must be created and passed for the product deletion functionality.
   - Integration tests should verify that the product is correctly removed from the database and that related data is handled properly.
   - User acceptance tests must confirm that the feature meets admin needs and expectations.

8. **Accessibility:**
   - The delete functionality should be accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
   - The UI should adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring that the delete option and confirmation prompt are usable.

9. **Security:**
   - Ensure that the delete functionality does not expose any sensitive data or introduce vulnerabilities.
   - Implement security measures to protect against unauthorized access or manipulation of product data.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Document the process for deleting products, including how to access the delete option, the confirmation process, and any relevant API endpoints.
    - Include details on the data model and how deletions are handled to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance.
