## User Story

**As a user**, I want to apply multiple filters simultaneously (e.g., genre, price range, platform) so that I can narrow down my search to find the most relevant game vouchers.

## Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (DoD)

1. **Multiple Filters Functionality:**
   - Users should be able to apply multiple filters at the same time, such as genre, price range, and platform.
   - The filters should be applied simultaneously to narrow down search results.

2. **Dynamic Filtering:**
   - The product listings should update dynamically to show only vouchers that meet all selected filter criteria.
   - The filtering should be applied immediately, updating results without requiring a page reload.

3. **UI/UX:**
   - The filter options for genre, price range, platform, and other criteria should be easily accessible and clearly labeled.
   - Users should be able to see the applied filters and modify or remove them as needed.

4. **Filter Results:**
   - The filtered results must accurately reflect the combination of selected filters, showing only products that match all criteria.
   - Each result should display relevant details such as name, price, description, and any special offers.

5. **Performance:**
   - The filtering process should be optimized for fast response times, even when multiple filters are applied.
   - The system should handle complex filter combinations efficiently.

6. **Database Integration:**
   - The filtering logic must be integrated with the database to retrieve and display products that match the selected filter criteria.
   - The database schema must support efficient querying based on multiple filters.

7. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests must be created and passed for the multiple filters functionality.
   - Integration tests should ensure that multiple filters interact correctly with the database and return accurate results.
   - User acceptance tests must confirm that the multiple filters feature meets user needs and expectations.

8. **Accessibility:**
   - The multiple filters feature should be accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
   - The UI should adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring that all interactive elements related to filtering are usable.

9. **Security:**
   - Ensure that the filtering process does not expose any sensitive data or introduce vulnerabilities.
   - Implement security measures to protect against unauthorized access or manipulation of filter criteria.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Document the multiple filters functionality, including how to use various filters and any relevant API endpoints.
    - Include details on the data model and how multiple filters are applied to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance.
