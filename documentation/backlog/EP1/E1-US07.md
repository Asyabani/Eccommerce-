# User Story
**As a user**, I want to receive a confirmation after updating my profile information so that I know my changes have been saved successfully.

# Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (DoD)

1. **Profile Update Form:**
   - Users must have access to a form or interface to update their profile information.
   - The form should include fields for all editable profile details (e.g., name, email, phone number).

2. **Form Validation:**
   - The profile update form must validate user inputs to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly and meet validation rules (e.g., valid email format).
   - Validation should occur on both the client-side (browser) and server-side to prevent incorrect data submission.

3. **Update Processing:**
   - Upon form submission, the system must process the profile update request.
   - The updated information must be saved in the database.

4. **Confirmation Message:**
   - After the profile information is successfully updated, the user must receive a confirmation message indicating that their profile has been updated successfully.

5. **Display Updated Information:**
   - The updated profile information should be immediately reflected on the userâ€™s profile page and any relevant sections where the profile details are displayed.

6. **Security:**
   - Ensure that the profile update process is secure, with proper authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.

7. **Code Review:**
   - The code for updating and confirming profile information must be reviewed by peers to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.

8. **Documentation:**
   - The profile update process should be documented, including any API endpoints used, validation rules, and security measures.
