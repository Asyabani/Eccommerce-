# User Story
**As a user**, I want to change my password so that I can maintain the security of my account.

# Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (DoD)

1. **Password Change Form:**
   - Users must have access to a password change form from their account settings or profile page.
   - The form must require users to enter their current password, new password, and confirm the new password.

2. **Form Validation:**
   - The form must validate that the new password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
   - The system must ensure that the new password and confirmation password match.
   - Validation should occur on both the client-side (browser) and server-side to prevent incorrect data submission.

3. **Password Update Processing:**
   - Upon form submission, the system must authenticate the current password and process the password change request.
   - The new password must be securely hashed and stored in the database.
   - Error handling must be in place to manage issues such as incorrect current passwords or failed updates.

4. **Confirmation Message:**
   - After a successful password change, the user must receive a confirmation message indicating that their password has been updated.

5. **Security:**
   - All password data must be securely hashed and stored using industry-standard encryption techniques.
   - Implement security measures to protect against unauthorized access and ensure the new password is not exposed during the process.

6. **Code Review:**
   - The code for the password change functionality must be reviewed by peers to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.

7. **Documentation:**
   - The password change process should be documented, including any API endpoints used, validation rules, and security measures.
