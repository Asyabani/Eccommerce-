# User Story
**As a user**, I want to manage my notification preferences so that I can choose how I receive updates from the platform.

# Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (DoD)

1. **Notification Preferences Page:**
   - Users must have access to a notification preferences page from their account settings.
   - The page should allow users to view and edit their current notification settings.

2. **Preference Options:**
   - Users should be able to select their preferred methods of notification (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications).
   - Users should also be able to choose the types of notifications they wish to receive (e.g., order updates, promotions).

3. **Form Validation:**
   - The form for updating notification preferences must validate user inputs to ensure selections are correctly recorded.
   - Validation should occur on both the client-side (browser) and server-side to ensure accurate data submission.

4. **Update Processing:**
   - Upon form submission, the system must process the notification preferences update request.
   - The updated preferences must be saved securely in the database.

5. **Confirmation Message:**
   - After successfully updating notification preferences, the user must receive a confirmation message indicating that their preferences have been updated.

6. **Database Entry:**
   - Notification preferences must be accurately stored in the database.
   - Preferences should be retrievable and correctly reflected when accessed by users or administrators.

7. **Security:**
   - Access to the notification preferences page must be secured to ensure that only authenticated users can modify their own settings.
   - Implement security measures to protect against unauthorized access and ensure data privacy.

8. **Code Review:**
   - The code for managing notification preferences must be reviewed by peers to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.

9. **Documentation:**
    - The notification preferences management process should be documented, including any API endpoints used, validation rules, and security measures.
